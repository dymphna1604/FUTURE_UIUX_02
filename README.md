# FUTURE_UIUX_02

Fitness App UI Design

This is a mobile-first fitness app designed in Figma. This project explores real-world UI/UX principles for personalized fitness tracking, mindful workouts, and calm digital experiences. 

About the Project

This concept was developed as part of a practical UI/UX challenge to design a personalized workout planner that feels calm, simple, and empowering. The app allows users to set goals, track workouts, and visualize progress through a clean and intuitive interface. Every screen was designed to reduce friction and help users stay consistent without pressure or clutter.

Features

Fitwave includes a guided onboarding process where users select their gender, body stats, and fitness goals. The dashboard displays key metrics such as calories burned, daily steps, and total active workout minutes. Users can browse an exercise library featuring tailored routines like Full Body Strength or Morning Flow Stretch, and view detailed workout pages focused on control, breath, and balance. The overall design is minimal, mindful, and fully mobile-first.


Tools Used

This project was designed entirely in Figma for wireframing, prototyping, and visual design. GitHub was used for version control and documentation throughout the design process.
